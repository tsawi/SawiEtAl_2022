# SpecUFEx 

SpecUFEx stands for "Unsupervised Spectral Feature Extraction", an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that characterizes time variations in spectral content of waveform data. 
\\
SpecUFEx combines probabilistic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and hidden Markov modeling (HMM) of spectrograms (short time Fourier transforms of waveform data) to generate "fingerprints", low dimensional representations of spectral variation through time. Both the NMF and HMM models are fit using stochastic variational inference; the method is therefore scalable to tens or hundreds of thousands of spectrograms. The resulting fingerprints can be used as features for either unsupervised (e.g. clustering) or supervised (e.g. classification) machine learning. The method is described in
